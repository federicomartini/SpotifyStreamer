# SpotifyStreamer
Spotify Streamer 1.0 releases. 

## Build
Sources have been compiled with Android Studio 1.2.2, so it's enough if you download repository files
and open the whole project with the IDE.

## Minimum requirements
In order to run Spotify Streamer application, you need a device whose API version is between 15 and 22.
Internet permission are also needed, because the application interact with Spotify servers.

## Notes
Version 1.0 has been built only to test communication with Spotify Servers, so don't expect any audio streaming. This
feature is under development and will be released in the near future.
